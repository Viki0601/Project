My first experience with GitHub was both exciting and educational. As a novice in version control and collaboration tools, 
I was eager to explore its capabilities. Setting up my repository for a machine learning classification project using a COVID-19 dataset was straightforward, 
thanks to GitHub's intuitive interface. I appreciated the seamless process of initializing the repository, committing changes, and pushing updates. 
Creating a structured project directory helped me stay organized and maintain clarity in my work. The ability to track changes and manage different versions of my files was incredibly beneficial.
Furthermore, writing a comprehensive README file enhanced my understanding of documentation's importance in project sharing. 
This experience not only boosted my confidence in using GitHub but also underscored the value of collaborative coding and open-source contributions. 
Overall, GitHub has become an essential tool in my development workflow, enabling efficient project management and collaboration.

Project Workflow
Data Preparation:

Load the raw data from the data/raw/ directory.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
Save the processed data to the data/processed/ directory.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.
Visualize important features and relationships.
Feature Engineering:

Select relevant features for the classification task.
Create new features if necessary.
Model Training:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
Model Evaluation:

Compare the performance of different models.
Select the best model based on evaluation metrics.
Deployment:

Save the trained model for future use.
(Optional) Create a simple API or web application to serve the model.
Results
Summarize the key findings and results of your classification task. Highlight the performance of the best model and any insights gained during the analysis
